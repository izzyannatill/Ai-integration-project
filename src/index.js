Mention the user's star sign only once in the entire text, ensuring that each section is relevant to its heading. The tone should be similar to the following example: "Between now and August 28, you might rethink your wellness regimen or revisit a project that’s been languishing on the shelf. Be patient with crossed wires on the job and give coworkers the benefit of the doubt for now. With proactive Mars enjoying a rare meetup with enthused Jupiter in Gemini and your domestic quarters today, you might be excited to tackle a household project, but only proceed if there’s an airtight plan in place."`;
